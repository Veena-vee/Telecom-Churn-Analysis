# Telecom Churn Analysis using Machine Learning

### Description
Customer churn is defined as when customers or subscribers discontinue doing business with a firm or service. customer churn is a critical metric because it is less expensive to retain existing customers than it is to acquire new customers.To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

### PROJECT OBJECTIVE:

### Data
TelcomCustomer-Churn_1

TelcomCustomer-Churn_2

### STEPS AND TASKS:
Data Understanding & Exploration

Data Cleaning & Analysis

Model building
Used different models:
  1. Logistic Regression
  2.  Decision Tree
  3.  Random Forest
  4.  Ada Boost
  5.  XGBoost

### Result
From the above practice, Multiple factors influence customer's dissatisfaction, including quality of service and network quality.

Customers having numerous issues with phone services and online services, will be more likely to seek better alternatives.

An expensive tariff plan results in a high fixed cost for the customer. When the needs of a customer do not correspond to the chosen tariff plan, we say that the customer is wrongly positioned.

A wrong positioning results in most cases to a higher bill than expected, and is a significant cause of churn.
